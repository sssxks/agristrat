# Problem

Based on the actual conditions of rural areas, making full use of limited arable land resources and developing organic farming industries according to local conditions is of great practical significance for the sustainable development of rural economies. Choosing suitable crops and optimizing planting strategies can facilitate field management, improve production efficiency, and reduce planting risks caused by various uncertainties.

A certain rural area is located in the mountainous region of North China, with low temperatures year-round, and most arable land can only be planted once a year. The village currently has 1,201 mu of open-air arable land, divided into 34 plots of different sizes, including **dry land, terraced fields, hillside land, and irrigated land**. Dry land, terraced fields, and hillside land are suitable for planting one season of grain crops annually; irrigated land is suitable for planting one season of rice or two seasons of vegetables annually. The village also has 16 ordinary greenhouses and 4 smart greenhouses, each with 0.6 mu of arable land. Ordinary greenhouses are suitable for planting one season of vegetables and one season of edible fungi annually, while smart greenhouses are suitable for planting two seasons of vegetables annually. Except for a few crops, different crops can be planted together in the same plot (including greenhouses) each season.

According to crop growth patterns, the same crop cannot be continuously planted in the same plot (including greenhouses) to avoid yield reduction. Since soil containing legume root bacteria is beneficial for other crops' growth, starting from 2023, each plot (including greenhouses) must plant legumes at least once within three years. The planting plan should also consider convenient farming operations and field management, such as avoiding scattered planting areas for each crop per season and maintaining a suitable planting area for each crop in individual plots (including greenhouses).

Assuming that the expected sales volume, planting costs, yield per mu, and selling prices of various crops remain stable compared to 2023, and crops planted each season are sold in the same season. If the total production of a certain crop in each season exceeds the expected sales volume, the excess cannot be sold normally. Please provide optimal crop planting plans for this rural area from 2024 to 2030 for the following two scenarios, and fill in the results in result1_1.xlsx and result1_2.xlsx respectively:

(1) The excess is unsold, causing waste;
(2) The excess is sold at 50% of the 2023 selling price.
